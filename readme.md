# Comfy Bot
This is the GitHub page for discord bot Comfy.
You can see more of the bot from the [top.gg page](https://top.gg/bot/900706330183102525)
The goal of this project is to get the bot verified by discord. This means the bot needs to be in 75 or more servers.

## Discord API Wrapper
This project uses pycord which is a fork of discord.py
I won't give any installation advice because no one will probably see this.
